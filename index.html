        <p>You really think you can fly that thing? I was part of something special. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.</p>
        <p>Just my luck, no ice. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Must go faster. You really think you can fly that thing? What do they got in there? King Kong? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Must go faster. You really think you can fly that thing?</p>
