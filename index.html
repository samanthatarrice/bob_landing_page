As you can see, I took that very literally! When I first joined this hackathon I was a little aprehensive. I have only been coding for the past four months, but when I saw the inspiration, I knew right away that I had to try it out. I just watched a Netflix documentary about Bob Ross a few weeks ago, which gave me more appreciation for his work. I have also always enjoyed art and love to create things, and actually studied Art for my B.A..</p>
        <p>The idea for combining the paint app idea with a search and find game came from another project I started working on just the weekend before the start of this hackathon. I had an idea to create a game app for my two and a half year old daughter. I wanted it to be something easy and fun for her to practice finding things. Also, when each item is found, a different activity or game would pop-up. At first, I thought that these would be simple activities such as puzzles, and identifying shapes and numbers. However, after hearing our task for this project, I thought it would also be great to include a painting option! Even though I had already started on my "Search & Learn" app the weekend just before the start of this hackathon, I decided to start from scratch and channel my inner Bob Ross as much as possible for this "Search & PAINT" app. Time to look for cute icons of happy trees! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ²</p>
        <p>I'm pretty happy with my final MVP. It's interesting that the process of creating this app kind of reminded me of "zone" I get into when I paint or create art. I learned a ton along the way, including how to work with the canvas element as well as many more CSS properties I hadn't used before and more practice with JS logic. Also, this is the first project I have completed that required a landing page and readme, and this is something I am now considering adding to some of my current and future projects as well. While the final product only really works on desktops, my next steps are to continue learning more about touch events so I can make this work on tablets too (it somehow works on my phone...however it only allows me to draw dots). I think this idea can also be taken further, and made into an educational app about different artists, where each has a different page. Of course, once I have learned more backend development, I would like to add options to save the drawings as well.</p>

        <p>I am a former teacher turned web developer. While I will always value the time I had as a teacher, and feel like many of the skills I learned in that career are proving useful in this next journey, I am loving learning to code! When I'm not programming, I spend my time playing with my daughter, cooking, reading, and exploring new places. I currently live in Brazil, where my husband and I moved to over four years ago to teach at an international school. We are from the Bay Area, CA, and plan to move back to the states in the summer of 2022!</p>

      <p>This has been such a fun process, and feel so fortunate to have found out about this incredible opportunity. I've learned so much! Monarch and Navi have been so helpful and hands-on throughout this whole hackathon, and us newbie developers are so lucky to have them around. I also want to give a shout out the the amazing women I met at the Girls Develop It November 2021 Hackathon just a week ago. (Go team Green Thumbs!) I wouldn't have found out about this if it wasn't for that community, and they have been a huge support and wealth of knowledge and resources.</p>
